This cover features my rendition of the Quidditch game in the triwizard championship in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire. The screen has a Snitch, the ball used in the championship, moving at  a random x position , y position and the loop that the ball passes through is synced with the mouse position and moves along with it. Once the balls co-ordinates match the coordinates of the mouse, the ball would return to its original state. The background will gradually change color from light to dark.
