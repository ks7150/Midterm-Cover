This cover features my rendition of the Quidditch game in the Harry Potter Series. The screen has a Snitch, the ball used in the championship, moving at  a random x position , y position and the loop that the ball passes through qis synced with the mouse position and moves along with it. Once the balls co-ordinates match the coordinates of the mouse, the ball would return to its original state. The background will gradually change color from light to dark. I used a randomised position for both x and y, which shifts to the initial state once the Snitch touches the loop or the distance of the ball is less than 30 points from the hoop. The movement of the ball is very rapid and randomised to make it unpredictable for the people interacting with it. When the ball touched the hoop, there is a red score of 150 flashes to let the user know that they have touched the Snitch and it resets to its original state.
The second ball, red, is the quaffle, and when the user touches this ball with the hoop, a score of 10 flashes on the screen before it is reset to its original state. 
The entire screen resets when the snitch(small) is touched, while touching the quaffle only resets the screen for the red one.
