This cover features my rendition of the Quidditch game in the Harry Potter Series. The screen has a Snitch, the ball used in the championship, moving at  a random x position , y position and the loop that the ball passes through is synced with the mouse position and moves along with it. Once the balls co-ordinates match the coordinates of the mouse, the ball would return to its original state. The background will gradually change color from light to dark. I used a randomised position for both x and y, which shifts to the initial state once the Snitch touches the loop or the distance of the ball is less than 30 points from the hoop.
